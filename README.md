# UGV_models
The repository contains an original agent-based model devoleped within the project 'Developing the intelligent system for control of unmanned ground vehicles with use of agent-based methods, fuzzy clustering and genetic algorithms'. The main folder contains the developed multiagent transportation model of the unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs)â€™ behavior implemented within the FLAME GPU Framework (please, see flamegpu.com). Note, the installation process is needed and descoped here: https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2/ In particular, you can use MS Visual Studio 2019 for compiling and running this model, if the NVIDIA card is available.
